Jarvis
As the project name says i am trying to replicate Iron mans Jarvis software. I know everyone who loves iron man wishes they could have their own jarvis !! here is a simplified version of it i will add on to it over time however this is also a template for anyone to use! so please feel free to download it and make any adjustments you need for your own preferences.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:
1. There are two files for the jarvis program new and main. The new one is uses sql to store all the commands into a database to make the code less cluttered as overtime you might make this overly complicated and its easier to store everything seperately .

2. Text to speach conversion

pip install pyttsx3
3. Speach recognition

pip install speechRecognition
4. SQL connector

pip install mysql-connector-python
